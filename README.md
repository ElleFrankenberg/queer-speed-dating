## Queer Speed Dating

This is a responsive full-stack application developed as a helpful and fast tool for organizers of queer speed dating events.

How it works:
Participants at the event enter their personal details in the participant form on the application's homepage. These details are then stored in MongoDB, and a dedicated page is created for each participant. After the event concludes, participants submit a paper to the organizers with a completed form, indicating the names of the other participants they'd like to be friends with, date, or both.

Subsequently, the organizers create an account or sign in to the application to access its matchmaking functionality. On each participant's page, the organizer fills out the participant's "likes" form according to the submitted preferences. When all participants' "likes" forms are completed, the organizers receive lists of all love and friend matches from that event. These matches are listed with separate lists for love matches and friend matches on the "All Matches" page. And also on each participant's individual page, displaying that particular participant's matches.
